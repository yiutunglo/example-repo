Responsive Design for periodic table

1. The page should be responsive to changing screen dimensions until such a point 
where the table loses its structure, at which point it will be replaced by an image
of the periodic table.
2. The table can be created using either the Grid layout.
3. Ensures that the design adapts to different screen sizes, 
maintaining a user-friendly layout across devices.
